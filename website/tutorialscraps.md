An interest can be subjected to various "limitations" and "conditions" that can affect whether and when it becomes possessory, terminate it before its natural duration, or even terminate a previous interest. There are four common patterns:

* `to A until B graduates college`: a **limitation** that can cause an interest to terminate early if a condition is satisfied.
* `to A, but if B graduates college to B`: an **executory interest** that can cause an interest to divest an earlier interest if a condition is satisfied.
* `to A, but if B graduates college then the grantor may reenter`: a **condition subsequent** that can allow the grantor to terminate an interest.
* `to A for life, then if B has graudated college to B`: a **condition precedent** that must be satisfied for an interest to become possessory.

These patterns are all clear and conceptually simple. Unfortunately, they give rise to a bewildering variety of differently named interests.


For practical purposes, you can think of executory interests as always being contingent: they are always effectively subject to a condition precedent. But this is an informal shorthand. The concept of vesting does not officially apply to them. Similarly, one never hears about a reversion or other interest retained by the grantor being "vested" or "contingent." It is not a concept that applies to them, either.


This version of merger did not apply when all of the interests were created by the same conveyance, on the theory that the grantor intended them all to take effect. Compare: 


```
To A for life, then if B has married to B for life, then to A and her heirs.
```



The next example shows the harsh consequences the rule of convenience can have for identified potential class members with contingent interests. The class closes at A's death because C, who has graduated college, is entitled to possession.

```
O conveys to A for life, then to the children of B who graduate college.
B has child C.
B has child D.
B dies.
A dies.
C graduates college.
D graduates college.
```

### Historical Background ###

The landowners and lawyers who were responsible for creating the system of estates in land had many goals, but one of the most important to them, and one which had an lasting impact on property law, was to create enduring dynaties of wealth, in which land passed down from one generation to the next within a family, forever -- or as close to it as they could get. From their perspective, the problem with a fee simple was that it was **alienable**: the current owner could always convey it away to a stranger (perhaps in exchange for some ready money to pay off a creditor), taking it out of the family. 

A life estate was more useful for dynastic planning, because the life tenant can give away only what they have: the right to possess and use the property during their lifetime. At their death, it goes automatically to the owner of the remainder (traditionally called the **remainderman**, although of course many of them were not male). The conveyance `to A for life, then to A's eldest child for life, then to A's eldest child's eldest child` keeps the property in one family line for two generations; neither A nor A's eldest child can alienate more than their life estate. 

But even life estates have their limits. For one thing, any finite sequence of life estates eventually ends. In the conveyance above, A's grandchild _can_ alienate a fee simple, taking the property out of the family line. For another thing, they can be inflexible. What if A has two children, but only the _younger_ child has children of their own? The grantor might have wanted A's eldest grandchild to receive the property, but the conveyance as written doesn't so that. Instead, the gift to "A's eldest child's eldest child" fails entirely; no such person exists. While it is possible to imagine more complicated grants, the solution that the common law settled on was different.

### Transferring a Fee Tail ###

The estate **in fee tail** was an estate limited to the descendants of a particular named individual. It resembled a life estate, but instead of _terminating_ at the dead of the current tenant, it _transfers_ to that tenant's oldest surviving child. At that person's death, again it transfers to their oldest surviving child. The overall effect is to stack up a series of interests for life in a chain of descendants. But whereas successive life estates must be created explicitly and individually, a fee tail can generate an arbitrarily large number of successive lifetime rights to possession.
